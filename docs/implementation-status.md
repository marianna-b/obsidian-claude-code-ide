- ✅ `formatToolResponse()` helper implemented
- ✅ `formatErrorResponse()` helper implemented
- ✅ All tools updated to use helpers
- ✅ Tests verify JSON parsing
- **Status**: Fully implemented with 100% test coverage

### 12. ✅ Tool: getDiagnostics (LOW)
- ✅ Returns empty diagnostics array (Obsidian has no LSP)
- ✅ JSON-stringified format
- ✅ Tests included
- **Status**: Already implemented correctly

## ❌ Not Started / Incomplete Tasks

### 4. ❌ Tool: getLatestSelection (MEDIUM)

### 10. ❌ Notification: at_mentioned (MEDIUM)
- Need to add command to send selection
- Emit notification via WebSocket
- Add to command palette

### 13. ❌ Tool: executeCode (NOT APPLICABLE)
- Just needs stub implementation

## 📊 Summary

**Completed**: 5/11 tasks (45%)
- All HIGH priority tasks except notifications
- Response standardization complete
- Testing infrastructure in place

**Remaining**: 6/11 tasks (55%)
- Mostly MEDIUM and LOW priority
- Some are simple implementations
- executeCode is just a stub

## 🎯 Next Steps (by priority)

1. **getLatestSelection** - MEDIUM, requires selection caching
2. **getOpenEditors** - MEDIUM, straightforward implementation
3. **getWorkspaceFolders** - MEDIUM, simple vault info
4. **at_mentioned notification** - MEDIUM, user command
5. **checkDocumentDirty** - LOW, might need fallback
6. **saveDocument** - LOW, simple implementation
7. **executeCode** - NOT APPLICABLE, just stub
